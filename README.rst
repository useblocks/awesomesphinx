Awesome Sphinx
==============

An automatically collected and manually curated list of `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_
extensions, themes and other Sphinx-related projects.

**List and Documentation at https://awesomesphinx.useblocks.com/**

Motivation
----------
There is an often-referenced list of Sphinx extensions:
https://github.com/yoloseem/awesome-sphinxdoc

But this list is unmaintained for ~2 years and covers only a subset of available 
extensions. 

Therefore this project was created, which provides an automated way to keep
itself always up to date.

Contribute
----------

Help is always welcome, especially for page and user interface design.

More details on our `Contribute <https://awesomesphinx.useblocks.com/contribute.html>`__ page.

Add/Update extension
--------------------
All data is automatically collected from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`__ 
and `Github <https://github.com/>`__.

So the easiest way to get your extension on this list is by having the right
meta-data in your package on PyPI.
